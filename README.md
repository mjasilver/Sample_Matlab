# Sample_Matlab
This repository contains sample code I wrote in Matlab
The files contained in this repository are from an exercise in my machine learning class through UMN.
The assignment was to construct a K-means algorithm, which would classify datapoints into K colors based on the algorithm. The final output is a number of pictures of a stadium before and after color classificaiton.
